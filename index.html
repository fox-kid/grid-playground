            <h1>Daeodon</h1>
            <p>
                Daeodon is an extinct genus of entelodont even-toed ungulates that inhabited North America about 23 to 20 
                million years ago during the latest Oligocene and earliest Miocene. The type species is Daeodon shoshonensis,
                described by a very questionable holotype by Cope. Some authors synonimize it with Dinohyus hollandi and several 
                other species (see below), but due to the lack of diagnostic material, this is questionable at best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another large member of this family, similar in size to Daeodon, is the Asian Paraentelodon, but it is known by very incomplete material.
            </p>
            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>
                Although not specified in Cope's original description, the name Daeodon comes from the Greek words daios, 
                meaning "hostile" or "dreadful" and odon, meaning "teeth".
            </p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Daeodon shoshonensis is the largest-known entelodont; 
                known adult individuals had skulls about 90 cm (3 ft) long and 
                were about 1.77 m (5.8 ft) tall at the shoulders. It's differentiated from other entelodonts 
                by a suite of unique dental characters, the shape and relatively small size of the cheekbone 
                flanges of its skull compared to those of Archaeotherium, and the small size of its chin tubercle,
                as well as features of its carpus and tarsus and the fusion of the bones of the lower leg. 
                Like other entelodonts, its limbs were long and slender with the bones of the foreleg fused together 
                and with only two toes on each foot. It also had a relatively lightly constructed neck for the size 
                of its head, whose weight was mostly supported by muscles and tendons attached to the tall spines of 
                the thoracic vertebrae, similar to those of modern-day bison and white rhinoceros.
            </p>
            <h2>Paleoecology</h2>
            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>
                Daeodon had a wide range in North America, with many fossils found in Agate Fossil Beds, representing 
                an environment in a transition period between dense forests and expansive prairie, likely a major cause 
                of their extinction in the middle Miocene.[16] It adapted to the grassland with a more cursorial body plan 
                than more basal entelodonts like Archaeotherium, losing their dewclaws entirely, proximally fused metacarpals, 
                and similar shoulder musculature to bison.
            </p>
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
                Daeodon was omnivorous like all other entelodonts. Enamel patterns suggest eating of nuts, roots, and vines, 
                as well as meat and bones. The superficial similarity to peccaries, hippos, and bears implies a wide range in 
                terms of what plants Daeodon may have been eating. The dry seasons of North America at the time could get very harsh, 
                so they may have supplemented their water intake by eating grape vines. The extent of its carnivory is debated, 
                but tooth wear suggests they specialized in crushing bone and ripping meat, and bite marks on chalicothere bones 
                suggest they either hunted or scavenged large herbivores. Foss (2001) argues its head was far too heavy to be 
                effective in taking down large prey so it must have relied exclusively on scavenging, but its bison-like adaptations 
                for running, the stereoscopic vision characteristic of predators, and evidence of predation in entelodonts calls this 
                interpretation into question. The uncertainty of their diets suggests they were likely opportunistic omnivores 
                similar to bears, eating whatever they need depending on the circumstance.
